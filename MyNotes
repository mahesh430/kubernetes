A Deployment's rollout is triggered if and only if the Deployment's Pod template (that is, .spec.template) is changed, for example if the labels or container images of the template are updated. Other updates, such as scaling the Deployment, do not trigger a rollout.
  
  kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
         or
  kubectl edit deployment/nginx-deployment
